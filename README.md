# 🛡️ AI-Driven Plagiarism Intelligence for Assignments  
> _Built entirely with IBM Granite + Watsonx + IBM Cloud Services_

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Academic institutions face increasing difficulty in detecting nuanced forms of plagiarism, especially when assignments are paraphrased or generated using AI tools. Traditional plagiarism checkers lack contextual sensitivity and cannot adapt to instructor-specific feedback or writing patterns. This weakens the enforcement of academic integrity.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

An adaptive plagiarism detection system powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **IBM Granite Foundation Models**, deployed on **IBM Cloud**, that:

- Analyzes submissions semantically to detect paraphrased or AI-generated content  
- Learns from historical assignments and instructor feedback  
- Flags contextually inconsistent or suspicious sections  
- Adapts to specific grading styles and academic disciplines  
- Provides interpretable results to support instructor decision-making
